            <p>To attain maturity and perfection in any field, theoretical knowledge must be blended with practical
                application. Theory of MANAGEMENT needs to be tested and verified in various types of situations. Since
                a manager works in a dynamic and complex
                environment, practical training is essential for getting acquainted with the environment. This project
                report has been completed in a way to provide an analytical framework for understanding the theoretical
                as well as practical knowledge
                of human resource management and its importance in the running of any organization. In the following
                pages, I am sharing my wonderful experience and knowledge which I have been a part of since the last 2
                months.
